# AutoHotkey

Do you use windows? If yes you have to use <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>?
Is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc.

Here I've published my small collection of AutoHotkey scripts. Some scripts are written by me, some are modified by me, some are completely created by others.
