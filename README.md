# AutoHotkey

Do you use windows? If yes you have to use <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>?
Is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc.

Here I've published my small collection of AutoHotkey scripts. Some scripts are written by me, some are modified by me, some are completely created by others.

Here is a list of them

- <a href="https://github.com/Tizio0o0o0o/ahk/blob/main/Mouse_to_shift_and_ctrl.ahk" target="_blank">Mouse_to_shift_and_ctrl</a> - useful if you use Fusion360 or SolidWorks
- <a href="https://github.com/Tizio0o0o0o/ahk/blob/main/Mouse_remove_letters.ahk" target="_blank">Mouse_remove_letters</a> - sometimes downloaded files are named with too many characters, always in the same place, this is a quick solution to cancel them
