# AutoHotkey

Do you use windows? If yes you have to use <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>!
Is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc.

Here I've published my small collection of AutoHotkey scripts. Some scripts are written by me, some are modified by me, some are completely created by others.

## Files:

- <a href="https://github.com/Tizio0o0o0o/ahk/blob/main/MouseToShiftAndCtrl.ahk">MouseToShiftAndCtrl.ahk</a> - I have a chinese mouse with two buttons on it. I decided to remap their function as ctl and shift. These are extremely useful while 3D modelling, especially if you use Fusion360 or SolidWorks.
- <a href="https://github.com/Tizio0o0o0o/ahk/blob/main/MouseRemoveLetters.ahk">MouseRemoveLetters.ahk</a> - sometimes downloaded files... are named with too many characters..., always in the same place..., this is a quick solution to cancel them. I usually pause the main mouse script and start this one for the short time period i need it.
- <a href="https://github.com/Tizio0o0o0o/ahk/blob/main/ItalianKeyboardLimits.ahk">ItalianKeyboardLimits.ahk</a> - Italian keyboard layout misses important and useful keys, let's add them back. I only included the ones I use the most, but suggestions are welcome.
